### Authentication

This release reverts to name and password authentication, because
GitHub's v3 API does support the token authentication previously
relied upon by giter8.  If you require access to templates in private
repositories, configure your GitHub user name (as before) as well as
your GitHub password:

    git config --global github.user your-user-name
    git config --global github.password your-password

Later, you can delete your password from `~/.gitconfig` where it has
been stored in the clear. Contributions to upgrade to the
[v3 OAuth flow][oauth] are welcome.

### Template Listing

We have regretfully disabled template listing (`-l` and `--list`)
because search is no longer supported in the GitHub API.

Later we hope to integrate with [ls.implicit.ly][ls] as a stable
listing service.
